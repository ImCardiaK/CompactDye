# CompactDye(Skript)

Use this Skript, to make the game colorants "stackable". Or in other words, you can with just one command render 64 dyes of the same color, into a "compacted dye".
You can completely change the name of the commands, and modify the name of each dye.

The basic commands are:
/uncompacted <color>
and
/compact <color>

If you want this to work, the player must have 64 dyes of one color to get 2 of that same dye, but in compacted.
